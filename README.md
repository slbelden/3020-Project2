# 3020-Project2

Task:  
Write a program that read N points in a plane and outputs any group of four or more colinear points (i.e. points on the same line). The obvious brute-force algorithm requires O(N^4) time. However, there is a better algorithm that makes use of sorting and runs in O(N^2 log n) time.
